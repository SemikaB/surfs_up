# Overview of analysis

The purpose of our analysis is to provide the temperature statistics for June and December inorder see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the .describe() method. 

* The total count for june = 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

# Summary
According to the analysed data its indicated that our temperatures are optimal; however other attributes to the weather such as precipitation indicates that we can run additional queries to be better informed on whether or not customers can  visit the shop. If we are able to obtain more data for the area we can run even more queries; henceforth  we can determine the best location and this would make this a more prominent location for visitors.
